Trying to implement a gas efficiency analyzer into slither by altering documentation within slither repo to provide workaround based on https://betterprogramming.pub/solidity-gas-optimizations-and-tricks-2bcee0f9f1f2.
Creating another folder named gas inefficiencies with informational level (green) detectors for different gas inefficiencies.
